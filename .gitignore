# ======================================================
# SQL Server files (for LocalDB / MDF files)
# ======================================================
# Important: If your .mdf and .ldf files are part of your *solution*,
# and you want them to be deployed with the app (e.g., for LocalDB),
# you might *not* want to ignore them if they are managed within the project.
# However, if they are dynamic or temporary development databases, ignoring is good.
# Based on your previous issues, it seems you want to manage them externally, so ignoring them is typical.
